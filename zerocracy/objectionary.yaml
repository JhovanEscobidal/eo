  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -20 points for
    this: -20 as a basis. Next time, create a new branch, push your changes over there,
    then make a pull request and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing
    via pull requests is a [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html). '

  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in objectionary/eo, the penalty amount is -20.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -20 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is +197. '

  greeting: "Great effort on your recent work! \U0001F31F For future reference, we
    recommend [naming Git branches](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html)
    after ticket numbers (e.g., \"`44`\") instead of \"`docs`\". This helps streamline
    our workflow. While this resulted in a -10 point adjustment, your overall balance
    remains positive at [+13](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
    Keep up the good work and let's continue improving together!"

  greeting: "Hey there, great job on your contribution! \U0001F389 You've scored +20
    points this time: +25 for the base, but we had to deduct 5 because there was only
    1 comment. Remember, more comments can boost your score! We love seeing your code,
    so [keep](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) 'em coming.
    Every hit-of-code counts (up to 30 points!), and thorough reviews can prevent
    deductions. Your current balance is [+3](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
    Keep up the awesome work!"

  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in objectionary/eo, the penalty amount is -20.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -20 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [+165](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). '
